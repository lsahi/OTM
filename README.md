# OTM

**OSU Tournament Matching** \
Currently a placeholder for a tournament-result-based match making rating system

# TL;DR
Project for OSU players' judgement for tournament
If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to push your own branch and contract me via lsahi@outlook.com

## General
There are many official or community-based ranking systems on OSU! such as pp, pp+, osu skills, cost, Maid Bot, OTSU(elo). Each of them shows only certain strengths or weakness. \
â†“ current situation \
_pp/pp+ or something based on best proformance_ -> Best proformance in single play (for best farmer or lucky dog). \
_Maid Bot or something based on their own match system_ -> Result based on the whole match. The player will not treat it as a formal match so they may can't do their best. (Even the player meets a map whose type is not for the player, or even the map itself not fit for the tournaments) \
_elo_ (a system running in China for OCL series) -> Collects match results from tournaments and heads-up match, and caculate a single result. It gives chances for skilled players in tournaments to get deeloed. Another problem is the system only work for Chinese that many derankers derankers accross the world get rid of the monitor.

## Target
To improve the tournament environment
To prevent players fucked by fucking derankers
To serve for the coming BFC(or something)

## Output
A judge system by mod/skill, by tournament results, by best performances.
An auto-matching system.
